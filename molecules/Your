#
Authenticating

The SpamHero API uses basic HTTP authentication. Your API key is the "username", the "password" is left blank. Most programming languages can add the correct header for you, check the examples below.
#
API limitations

Each API key is limited to 60 requests per minute. This limitation is not URL specific, so once 60 API requests of any kind have been made within one minute, further requests will be throttled. If it is suspected that the API is being abused (accessed with high frequency for extended periods of time, use of multiple keys to intentionally circumvent throttling, etc.), your API keys may be revoked.
#
Ordering service for new domains via the API

There are 3 API calls you'll want to make to set up service for a new domain. The first one is /api/reseller/order (or, /api/order if you are not a reseller).

Once your order has been placed with this API request, you'll want to call /api/order-check periodically until you've confirmed the order has been complete. (normally takes a few minutes).

Finally, you'll need to know when the required MX records are propagated, and what they are so you can update the domain's MX records. For this, you'll use /api/get-required-mx. View the documentation for each request for details.
